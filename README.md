# Lawyer Dashboard

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js) dashboard for managing legal cases and client interactions. The server uses Node.js with Express and MongoDB, while the client runs on React.

Development is at an early stage and additional instructions will be added as the project grows.
